Logic & Code Quality Fixes
| No. | Issue                                       | Fix Implemented                                                              | Benefit                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 4   | Mutable default argument (`logs=[]`)        | Changed to `logs=None` and initialized inside function                       | Prevents data sharing across function calls    |
| 5   | Unvalidated input types                     | Added explicit type checks (`isinstance`) for `item`, `qty`, and `threshold` | Prevents invalid operations and runtime errors |
| 6   | Global variable usage (`global stock_data`) | Removed `global` keyword and used `.clear()` + `.update()`                   | Makes function pure and avoids side effects    |
| 7   | Unused variables                            | Removed unused variables and parameters                                      | Reduces clutter and improves efficiency        |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | Broad exception handling (`except Exception:`) | Replaced with specific exceptions (`KeyError`, `ValueError`, `OSError`) | Improves debugging and avoids masking real errors   |
| 12  | No logging on errors                           | Added `logging.warning()` and `logging.error()` throughout              | Enables proper issue tracking and debugging         |
| 13  | Used `print()` for operational logs            | Replaced with Python‚Äôs `logging` module                                 | Adds structured logging for real-world applications |
| 14  | Missing exception safety for file operations   | Wrapped file read/write in `try-except`                                 | Prevents crashes and logs failures gracefully       |

 Reflection



1. Which issues were easiest/hardest to fix?

\- Easiest: Replacing print statements with logging.  

\- Hardest: Refactoring functions that used mutable defaults and broad exceptions.



2. Any false positives reported? 

\- Bandit flagged a harmless use of `input()` which was already sanitized.



3. How would you integrate static analysis into real projects? 

\- Add Pylint and Flake8 checks in a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) before merge.



4. Improvements observed after fixes:  

\- Code readability improved, logging added structure, and potential vulnerabilities removed.
